Since managers and suppliers have different responsibilities in your inventory management system, their first page after login should reflect what’s most important for their workflow.

Manager First Page (Dashboard Overview)
When a manager logs in, their first page should be an operational dashboard showing critical inventory stats and alerts. This helps them immediately assess the health of the system. Here’s what it could include:

📊 Inventory Summary → Total stock levels & low-stock warnings

🔔 Restock Alerts → Items that need urgent replenishment

🛒 Recent Orders → View pending & completed orders

🚚 Supplier Performance → Deliveries and order fulfillment rates

📈 Sales & Analytics → Trends, monthly insights, and reports

🎯 Goal: Enable managers to make quick decisions about inventory, orders, and supplier performance.

Supplier First Page (Order & Shipment Overview)
When a supplier logs in, their first page should focus on order fulfillment and managing their product inventory. This helps them prioritize deliveries and stock updates. Suggested content:

📦 Pending Orders → Orders waiting to be processed

🚚 Shipment Tracking → View current deliveries and expected arrival times

🔄 Inventory Updates → Stock levels, recent product changes

🏆 Best-Selling Products → Products in high demand

📜 Invoices & Payments → Manage billing

🎯 Goal: Make it easy for suppliers to track orders and keep inventory up-to-date.
